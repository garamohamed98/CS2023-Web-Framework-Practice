# CS2023-Web-Framework-Practice
This repository serves as a central hub for the web framework practice projects I'm working on during my computer science studies at [Your University Name]. As part of my coursework, I'm delving into various web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Laravel.

Inside this repository, you'll find code, documentation, and additional resources related to my practice with these technologies. I'm using this space to experiment, learn, and apply the concepts of web development and framework building.

What's Included:

HTML: Projects and exercises related to the creation of web pages and their structure.
CSS: Styling and design-related projects that enhance the visual appeal of web pages.
JavaScript: Code for interactive elements and dynamic behavior on web pages.
PHP: Server-side scripting and back-end development practice.
Laravel: Building web applications and dynamic websites using the Laravel PHP framework.
